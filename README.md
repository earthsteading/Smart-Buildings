# SmartBuildings
Smart buildings are utilitarian structures which are automated by an "internet of things' (IoT) which empower healthier structural forms for people, planet and profits[1].  The language around "Smart Buildings" and "Internet of Things" is an unfortunate product of technical jargon, which -while utilitarian- does not address the actual effects nor affects they will have on humanity.  The built environment within cities has the opportunity to be by intentional design, instead of a reactionary response as buildings are inhabited by thousand of devices, ad hoc.  The following report by Harvard University is a demonstration of the aims and objectives which our buildings should be structured.  Below is my summary of that report as evidence to this changing structural requirement.

## What are examples of Smart Buildings (and the IoT which empowers them):
  - [ ] intelligent lighting which creates ambiance befitting the human condition, e.g. lighting palette for community group think, calming lighting for studious behaviour, light colour changes as less-intrusive signalling for time boxing or changing environmental conditions, accessibility and universal access of spaces, etc.
  - [ ] automated monitorring of temperatures and environment envariables to harness the pausiv environment around buildings for an overall lower CO2 footprint, e.g. geopositioning of structures and exoskeletons to heat/cool a building via off-shore winds, underground cooling tubes and azimuth positioning for radiation, humidity, accounstic, etc.
  - [ ] improve the breathability and biohealth of commercial structures for human, plant, animal and planet, e.g. green environments, air quality testing and control (particles, VO2, biohazards, allergens, etc), encouraging diversity of life in builidings including therapay, mobility and bio-screening animals, etc.
  - [ ] all of the above can contribute to a commercial space which optimises the productivity of an organisation for greater profits.

## Who needs to be aware of the changes which Smart Building IoT will effect?
 - [ ] designers: in addition to the material, amenities and furniture within a building, the technical understanding of 'recipes for automation' will be required to create spaces which can meet multiple occupancy situations.
 - [ ] architects: design of space will increasingly be a team effort involving design consultants with an understanding for automation recipe's and the structural requirements for multiple (thousands) of internet connected devices will be present within a building.
 - [ ] building surveyors: laws, guidelines and the NCC will require enhanced expertise for energy efficiency reports and universal accessibility compliance guidelines, resulting in standards committees to adopt new National Construction Code compliance as well as new Australian Standards (AS xxxx).
 - [ ] fire-life safety officers: universal access and the ability to create intelligent actuators (noise and light signals, door and ventilation control, 
 - [ ] builders and trades-people: new tradies will increasingly become advocates for IoT innovations because of the ongoing maitenance (ESMs) which will be required for the thousands of devices present in a building.
